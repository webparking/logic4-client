# Logic4 client
Please note that this API client is not created or maintained by Logic4. For questions about Logic4 or it's API please contact Logic4 support. 

## Installation 
You can install the package via composer:
```bash
composer require webparking/logic4-client
``` 

## Configuration
In order to use the Logic4 API, you need to configure the `AccessTokenManager` with your credentials. You can do this by calling the `configure` method on the `AccessTokenManager` instance.
 
The following configuration options are required
- `public_key` - The public key of your Logic4 account
- `company_key` - The company key of your Logic4 account
- `username` - The username of your Logic4 account
- `secret_key` - The secret key of your Logic4 account
- `password` - The password of your Logic4 account
- `administration_id` - The administration id of your Logic4 account

The access token is automatically refreshed when it expires and stored in the cache. The cache object is set using the `$cache` property on the `AccessTokenManager` class and should implement the `Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface` interface.

After configuring the `AccessTokenManager` you can use any request class in your application without having to worry about the access token and other middleware.

### Example configuration
```php
# In this example, we load the configuration from a .env file.
$dotEnv = Dotenv\Dotenv::createImmutable(__DIR__);
$credentials = $dotEnv->load()

# We use the ArrayStore for testing purposes, but you can use any cache implementation that implements the Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface interface.
$cache = new \Illuminate\Cache\Repository(new \Illuminate\Cache\ArrayStore());
    
$tokenManager = new \Webparking\Logic4Client\AccessTokenManager($cache);
$tokenManager->configure($credentials);

# Initialize the ClientFactory using the AccessTokenManager
$clientFactory = new \Webparking\Logic4Client\ClientFactory($tokenManager);

# Initialize the request class using the ClientFactory
$request = new \Webparking\Logic4Client\Requests\ProductRequest($clientFactory);
$request->getProducts([
    'DebtorId' => 1,
]);
```

## Laravel integration
Integration with Laravel is easily done by configuring the `AccessTokenManager` after it has been resolved by the Laravel IoC Container.

Add the following code to your `AppServiceProvider` class:

```php
use Webparking\Logic4Client\AccessTokenManager;

$this->app
    ->afterResolving(AccessTokenManager::class, fn (AccessTokenManager $tokenManager) => $tokenManager->configure([
        'public_key' => config('services.logic4.public_key'),
        'company_key' => config('services.logic4.company_key'),
        'username' => config('services.logic4.username'),
        'secret_key' => config('services.logic4.secret_key'),
        'password' => config('services.logic4.password'),
        'administration_id' => config('services.logic4.administration_id'),
    ]));
```

This makes it possible to directly use any request class in your application without having to worry about the access token and other middleware.

### Example request

```php
use Webparking\Logic4Client\Requests\ProductRequest;
use Webparking\Logic4Client\Data\Product;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

/** @return array<Product> */
public function index(ProductRequest $productRequest, int $debtorId): array
{
    $products = $productRequest->getProducts([
        'DebtorId' => $debtorId,
    ]);
    
    return iterator_to_array($products);
}
```

## Testing
You can test the package by running `./vendor/bin/phpunit` in the root of the project. Make sure install the dependencies by running `composer install` before running the tests.

```bash
composer install
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Contributing
Please report any issue you find in the issues page. Pull requests are more than welcome.

### Generating endpoints

The endpoints can automatically be generated using the `generate` command. This command will generate a request class for each endpoint and a client class that can be used to instantiate the request classes.

```bash
make generate
```
